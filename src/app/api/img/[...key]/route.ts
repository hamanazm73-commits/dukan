 * Serves a shop photograph out of the bucket.
 *
 * Through here rather than straight from R2, which means the bucket never
 * has to be public. The free r2.dev address is rate-limited and documented
 * as development-only, and a custom domain on it would need the site's DNS
 * moved to Cloudflare — this needs neither. It also keeps the bucket's
 * address off the page entirely.
 *
 * Fetched over the S3 API and handed to Vercel's CDN with an immutable
 * year: keys are unique per upload, so a cached image can never be stale.
